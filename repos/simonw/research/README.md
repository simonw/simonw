# Research projects carried out by AI tools

Each directory in this repo is a separate research project carried out by an LLM tool - usually [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code). Every single line of text and code was written by an LLM.

See [Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/) for more details on how this works.

I try to include prompts and links to transcripts in [the PRs](https://github.com/simonw/research/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) that added each report, or in [the commits](https://github.com/simonw/research/commits/main/).

### [Mapping SQLite result columns back to their source `table.column`](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-column-provenance#readme) (2026-06-13 23:05)

Determining the source `table.column` for each result column in arbitrary SQLite queries is feasible because SQLite computes this internally and exposes it via its column-metadata API when compiled with `SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA`. While Python’s standard `sqlite3` module doesn’t surface this information, robust methods exist: using the third-party `apsw` library provides direct access with `cursor.description_full`, or a pure-stdlib ctypes bridge (`column_provenance.py`) can retrieve the metadata via direct calls to the system SQLite library—both accurately map even complex queries, recognizing expressions and handling joins, subqueries, and CTEs. Alternative approaches using `EXPLAIN` bytecode or the authorizer hook give partial information and are best for simple cases or dependency checks. For static analysis, `sqlglot` can resolve lineage using a supplied schema, including expressions.

**Key Tools and Projects:**
- [`apsw`](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw): exposes SQLite's column metadata directly for per-column provenance.
- [`column_provenance.py`](https://github.com/simonmichael/sqlite-column-provenance): pure-Python ctypes bridge that mirrors APSW’s results with no extra dependencies.

**Highlights:**
- Metadata APIs accurately resolve base column sources, expressions, and complex query structures without query execution.
- The standard library alone can suffice via clever ctypes usage, including handling in-memory databases.
- EXPLAIN-based approaches are best-effort and may falter on compound queries (like UNION).
- Authorizer methods over-report for output mapping but are valuable for access control.

### [Running untrusted queries: Datasette/SQLite vs psycopg/PostgreSQL](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/postgresql-time-limits-readonly#readme) (2026-06-11 04:17)

Exploring how untrusted SQL queries are safely run in Datasette (using SQLite) and whether similar protections can be applied with psycopg and PostgreSQL, this project shows that both can provide robust safeguards against data corruption and resource exhaustion. Datasette leverages hard read-only file modes and a VM progress handler for query timeouts, while PostgreSQL's privilege system enforces SELECT-only access and its `statement_timeout` cancels resource-intensive or sleeping queries. The PostgreSQL approach is even more flexible, offering configurable limits on memory, disk usage, and idle connections, though its read-only flag can be bypassed unless backed by proper GRANT restrictions. An experimental implementation (`pg_datasette_poc.py`) confirms that the core safety contract of Datasette is reproducible with PostgreSQL + psycopg.

- PostgreSQL's [statement_timeout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-STATEMENT-TIMEOUT) is stricter than SQLite's progress handler, aborting sleeping as well as CPU-bound queries.
- Hard read-only enforcement requires PostgreSQL's privilege system, not just transaction flags.
- Server-side cursors and new resource knobs (e.g., `temp_file_limit`, `work_mem`) further mitigate risk.
- Prototype code: [Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette), `pg_datasette_poc.py` (project proof-of-concept).

### [Can DuckDB run untrusted SQL as safely as Datasette runs SQLite?](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/datasette-duckdb-safety#readme) (2026-06-10 23:41)

Investigating the security of running untrusted SQL in DuckDB compared to Datasette with SQLite, this project establishes that DuckDB can be sandboxed to match—and sometimes exceed—the safety of SQLite, but requires more than its basic `read_only=True` option. Datasette achieves safe SQL exposure by using engine-level read-only connections and opcode-based time limits in SQLite, which inherently prevents unauthorized file or network access. DuckDB, by contrast, demands a hardened configuration (`enable_external_access=false`, `lock_configuration=true`) to block filesystem and network escapes, and lacks built-in query timeout, so the project introduces a watchdog thread to interrupt runaway queries. The provided [safe_duckdb.py](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/safe_duckdb.py) helper encapsulates these safeguards, and a prototype ([datasette_duckdb.py](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette_duckdb.py)) demonstrates Datasette serving a DuckDB file securely via its web interface.  

**Key findings:**
- `read_only=True` alone on DuckDB cannot prevent file/network access—extra settings and configuration lock are required.
- DuckDB lacks a progress-handler timeout, but a thread calling `connection.interrupt()` works reliably.
- DuckDB brings a hard memory limit and more configurable resource caps than SQLite.
- With proper hardening, DuckDB can safely expose public SQL query execution just as SQLite does in Datasette.

### [Running Python ASGI apps in the browser via Pyodide + a service worker](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/pyodide-asgi-browser#readme) (2026-05-30 15:34)

By running Python ASGI web applications entirely in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) and a dedicated service worker, this project intercepts all same-origin requests under `/app/` and executes them against the Python app via the ASGI protocol—removing the need for a backend server except for static files. The mechanism is demonstrated with both a FastAPI demo and the full [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) app, confirming its generality across ASGI apps. The design leverages a shell page that manages a persistent Pyodide Web Worker, with requests brokered from the service worker to Python. Thorough testing includes unit and browser tests, all passing, and offline operation is ensured by vendoring Pyodide and wheels locally. 

Key findings:
- Intercepted navigations, forms, and fetches are answered in-browser with Python ASGI, supporting redirects, JSON APIs, and full SQL interaction.
- The bridge works with both FastAPI and Datasette—proving the approach is not framework-specific.
- Fulfills complex requirements like authenticated root sessions, mitigating frame-busting headers and handling app-specific URL quirks.
- All 27 unit and browser tests pass; the system is fully offline-capable and restores navigable, bookmarkable URLs.
- See source and demos for implementation details and test harnesses.

### [pydantic-monty investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/monty-investigation#readme) (2026-05-22 22:41)

Reviewing [`pydantic-monty`](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) reveals it as a fast, minimal Python interpreter designed for controlled sandboxed execution, primarily useful when transforming data, branching, looping, and interacting with a select set of trusted host tools or a virtual filesystem. The interpreter purposefully omits large portions of CPython’s functionality, with clear boundaries: unsupported features and missing resources generally fail cleanly as structured errors rather than escaping into the host runtime. Security hinges on strict isolation—Monty code can’t directly access host resources except via explicit, trusted callbacks, which are outside the sandbox and should be tightly scoped. Resource limits (duration, memory, allocations, recursion) were reliably enforced, blocking runaway code, and virtual filesystem mounts behaved as expected, with overlay and sandbox modes.

Key findings:
- Unexpectedly wide subset of basic Python works: arithmetic, control flow, builtins, `sys`, `math`, `re`, and more (see [source tests](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/tree/main/tests)).
- Many dynamic, introspective, and advanced features are missing: classes, context managers, real imports, and dynamic introspection.
- Virtual filesystems allow controlled reads/writes; host access is only possible via explicitly-exported callbacks.
- F-string formatting flags in package version `0.0.17` showed silent omissions not aligned with source-level stricter parsing—future upgrades may tighten behavior.
- Type checking and snapshot pause/resume work, supporting async external calls and stateful agent workflows.
- Resource limits and sandboxing were robust, catching infinite loops, excessive allocations, and host access attempts.

### [TRE Python binding — ReDoS robustness demo](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/tre-python-binding#readme) (2026-05-04 17:52)

Demonstrating robust regex performance, this project offers a minimal Python ctypes binding to the [TRE regex library](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/), highlighting TRE’s immunity to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks that cripple Python's built-in `re` module. Key benchmarks show that TRE processes even notorious "evil" patterns on gigantic inputs (10 million characters) much faster than `re` on tiny ones, and scales linearly with input size instead of exponentially. The binding exposes compile and search functionality, includes rigorous ReDoS and scaling tests, and ensures bounded memory and reliable match-time behavior—with optional thread-based wall-clock timeouts. Limitations include the exclusion of back-references (a deliberate design tied to linear-time guarantees) and focus on core use-cases. The full test suite, benchmarks, and reproducible build scripts are provided, with results confirming linear performance and resilience against algorithmic blowup.

Key findings:
- TRE is robust against ReDoS patterns; Python `re` is not.
- Runtime with TRE grows linearly with input length, not exponentially.
- Memory usage during matching stays constant—even with enormous input.
- All tests (22 in total) pass quickly, confirming the claims.
- Project exposes a precise, safe API without exposing unstable features.

Relevant tools:
- [TRE regex library](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/)
- Project structure and tests: see `src/tre_py`, `tests/`, and `benchmark.py`

### [Claude system prompts as a git timeline](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/extract-system-prompts#readme) (2026-04-18 12:17)

Anthropic's published system prompt history for Claude is transformed into a git-based exploration tool, breaking up the monolithic markdown source into granular files and timestamped commits. By structuring extracted prompts per model, family, and revision, researchers can leverage `git log`, `diff`, and `blame` to trace prompt evolution, compare differences, and attribute changes to specific dates—all without manual parsing. The extraction workflow uses precise commit metadata to preserve chronology and clarity, enabling reproducible and detailed investigations of prompt adjustments across Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku model families. Access to both the original [Anthropic system prompts](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/system-prompts) and [prompt histories on GitHub](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/extract-system-prompts) facilitates transparent, permalinks, and fine-grained audit trails.

Key features:
- 26 prompt revisions across 14 models and three model families
- Four artifact types per revision, including per-model, per-family, and firehose files
- Git commit timestamps and authors reflect the original prompt dates for historical accuracy
- Idempotent extraction with reproducible results for future updates

### [Exploring the new `servo` crate](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/servo-crate-exploration#readme) (2026-04-13 15:04)

After the April 2026 release of the `servo` v0.1.0 crate ([blog post](https://servo.org/blog/2026/04/13/servo-0.1.0-release/)), a concise investigation shows that Servo is now an embeddable browser engine for Rust, with a clear API centered on the `ServoBuilder`, `WebView`, and pixel readback methods. A headless CLI (`servo-shot`) successfully renders URLs or HTML files to PNG, building against stable Rust with a robust software-based rendering pipeline. However, compiling the full engine to WebAssembly remains impractical due to SpiderMonkey and multi-threading limitations, though key Servo sub-crates like `html5ever` (HTML5 parser) can be compiled to wasm for in-browser single-page apps, as demonstrated in the [`html5ever-wasm-demo`](html5ever-wasm-demo) project. Documentation is thorough on [docs.rs/servo/0.1.0](https://docs.rs/servo/0.1.0).

**Key findings:**
- Servo's public embedding API is stable, modular, and developer-friendly for browser-like tasks in Rust.
- Native CLI (`servo-shot`) renders web content to PNG using software rendering, suitable for headless environments.
- Whole-engine WebAssembly compilation is blocked by non-wasm JS engine, threading, GL, and font dependencies; only subsystems like HTML parsing are wasm-ready.
- In-browser SPAs using Servo sub-crates (like HTML parsing) are feasible and lightweight, supporting educational tools and client-side content processing.

### [QuickJS Python Sandbox — Investigation Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/quickjs-async-sandbox#readme) (2026-04-12 23:15)

Exploring the [`quickjs`](https://pypi.org/project/quickjs/) Python package, this project implements an asyncio-compatible JavaScript sandbox with robust resource controls and seamless exposure of both synchronous and asynchronous Python functions (including async httpx fetches) to JavaScript code. The investigation verified critical sandbox features: hard memory caps, reliable wall-clock execution limits, concurrency, and safe async bridging — but also revealed three key constraints in QuickJS’s threading and callback model, shaping how the sandbox enforces timeouts and handles exceptions. For adversarial inputs, a process-based variant (`ProcessQuickJSSandbox`, see [sandbox_process.py](https://github.com/the-user/your-repo/blob/main/sandbox_process.py)) guarantees hard termination and isolation, albeit at higher start-up cost. The thread-based approach (`AsyncQuickJSSandbox`) is fast and sufficient for trusted-ish plugin code, with comprehensive example scenarios and caveats documented.

**Key findings:**
- Hard memory and wall-clock limits are enforced reliably; exposed Python functions (sync and async) are safely callable from JavaScript.
- QuickJS cannot interrupt a running `eval` from another thread, and built-in time limits break when callbacks are used; timeouts must be enforced externally.
- Python exceptions inside callbacks corrupt the JS context, necessitating error-wrapping techniques for callable exposure.
- Process sandbox is necessary for true termination safety with untrusted code; thread-based sandbox offers ~10× faster runs but may leak threads.
- JS-side concurrency (Promise fan-out) is limited by design in the thread sandbox; a more complex deferred resolution pattern is possible but not implemented for production.

**Useful tools:**
- [quickjs PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/quickjs/)
- Process-based sandbox example: `sandbox_process.py` (link depends on your repo)

### [SQLite WAL Mode Across Docker Containers Sharing a Volume](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-wal-docker-containers#readme) (2026-04-07 15:41)

SQLite’s WAL mode reliably supports concurrent access when two Docker containers share a volume on the same host, due to shared kernel and filesystem semantics. The experiment, using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for macOS and a named volume, demonstrated real-time propagation of database changes and effective memory-mapped file sharing by monitoring `.db-shm`. Both reading and concurrent writing tests returned zero errors, with all expected data visible in real time, confirming that mmap and POSIX file locking function as intended across containers. However, these guarantees fail in distributed or multi-host scenarios, or with network filesystems that lack proper mmap and locking support.

**Key findings:**
- WAL mode works reliably for SQLite across containers on the same host.
- Memory mapping (`mmap()`) and file locking are genuinely shared in Docker’s named volumes.
- Issues arise with NFS, CIFS, or distributed/cloud filesystems, where mmap and locks cannot synchronize across machines.
- See scripts and orchestration details in [the experiment toolkit](https://github.com/yourproject/sqlite-wal-docker-example).

### [Can JavaScript Escape a CSP Meta Tag Inside an Iframe?](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/test-csp-iframe-escape#readme) (2026-04-03 16:05)

JavaScript running inside a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe cannot escape or disable a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tag, even through removal, modification, or document replacement. Extensive testing across Chromium and Firefox confirmed that CSP policies defined via meta tags are enforced at parse time, and persist even when the iframe is navigated to a data: URI. While the sandbox attribute restricts capabilities, it does not block network requests on its own—only the CSP meta tag reliably prevents resource fetching and data exfiltration across browsers. Notably, Firefox ignores the `csp` iframe attribute, so the meta tag must always be used for security.

Key findings:
- JavaScript cannot remove or modify an enforced CSP meta tag; the policy remains active.
- `document.write()` and navigation to data: URI do not reset or bypass the original CSP.
- The `sandbox` attribute alone is insufficient for blocking network requests from untrusted code.
- The `csp` iframe attribute only works in Chromium, not Firefox ([Rodney](https://github.com/simonw/rodney) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) used for automation and validation).
- The CSP meta tag must be the first element in `srcdoc` for guaranteed enforcement.

### [Starlette 1.0 skill](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/starlette-1-skill#readme) (2026-03-23 00:05)

Starlette 1.0 Skill offers a concise guide for building robust web applications with Starlette, a lightweight ASGI framework. The accompanying demo showcases a task management app featuring projects, tasks, comments, and labels, illustrating Starlette's flexibility in handling routing, templating (Jinja2), async database operations (aiosqlite), and real-time updates. Developers can leverage [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) for customizable APIs and [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) as an ASGI server, streamlining development with modern Python tooling.

Key findings:
- Starlette enables rapid API and web app development with minimal overhead.
- Integrating aiosqlite and Jinja2 simplifies async data handling and dynamic templates.
- The skill provides clear steps for app structure, deployment, and real-world features.

### [PCGamer Article Performance Audit](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/pcgamer-audit#readme) (2026-03-22 22:49)

A performance audit of the March 2026 PCGamer article on RSS readers reveals severe page bloat, with over 82% of network traffic and transferred bytes traced to ad-tech, tracking, and programmatic advertising scripts. Despite the core content consisting of just 10-15 KB of text and a handful of images (~150 KB total), the page triggers over 431 network requests and 5.5 MB of transfer (18.8 MB decoded) within 60 seconds—ballooning to 200+ MB in Firefox due to autoplay video carousels and continuous ad/analytics refreshes. The site's heavy inlined styles/JavaScript, extensive third-party integrations, and JW Player video playlists account for the massive resource overhead, leading to an overhead-to-content ratio of at least 37:1. Tools such as [Prebid.js](https://prebid.org/) and [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/) are central to the programmatic ad and video experience, while Future PLC’s proprietary scripts (e.g., bordeaux.js) contribute substantial downstream activity.

**Key Findings:**
- 82.6% of data transferred is non-content (ads, tracking, identity, analytics)
- HTML includes 673 KB of inline CSS and 439 KB of inline JavaScript—far above best practices
- JW Player video carousel (with multiple autoplaying tracks) accounts for the largest single traffic source (up to 136 MB for 1080p renditions)
- Poor caching: Over 50% of requests are non-cacheable or lack cache headers
- 200+ MB can be transferred in 5 minutes on a modern browser, mostly due to video, ad refresh, and ongoing tracker activity

### [JavaScript Sandboxing Research](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/javascript-sandboxing-research#readme) (2026-03-22 19:53)

Analyzing current JavaScript sandboxing options for running untrusted code, this research compares core approaches in Node.js (including worker_threads, node:vm, and the Permission Model), prominent npm packages ([isolated-vm](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm), [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2)), and alternative engines like [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten). The findings show that most built-in tools (e.g., `vm` module and resourceLimits) are insufficient due to prototype escapes and weak enforcement of memory limits, while the Node.js Permission Model adds a helpful but bypassable OS-level seatbelt. For robust isolation, [isolated-vm] provides true V8 isolate separation with memory and CPU restrictions, but is in maintenance mode; [quickjs-emscripten] offers the strongest in-process isolation via WASM sandboxing at a significant performance cost. vm2 is not recommended due to a persistent stream of security escapes. When using Node.js worker_threads, combining Permission Model, stripped environment, resource limits, and a hardened engine (preferably isolated-vm or WASM-based QuickJS) delivers strongest defense-in-depth—though true security for highly adversarial code requires process isolation and OS/container sandboxing.

**Key Findings:**
- **Node.js built-in vm and resourceLimits are not secure against determined attackers.**
- **isolated-vm and quickjs-emscripten provide best-in-class in-process sandboxing; the latter offers WASM-level isolation but is much slower.**
- **vm2 is fundamentally broken for untrusted code despite frequent patches.**
- **Node.js Permission Model is effective for filesystem/process policy enforcement, but cannot stop prototype escapes or all I/O vectors.**
- **For maximal security, combine a hardened JS engine (like quickjs-emscripten in WASM) inside a restricted worker, plus OS/container-level sandboxing.**

### [SQLite Tags Benchmark: Comparing 5 Tagging Strategies](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-tags-benchmark#readme) (2026-03-20 02:57)

Benchmarking five tagging strategies in SQLite reveals clear trade-offs between query speed, storage, and implementation complexity for workflows involving tags (100,000 rows, 100 tags, average 6.5 tags/row). Indexed approaches—materialized lookup tables on JSON and classic many-to-many tables—easily outperform others, handling single-tag queries in under 1.5 milliseconds, while raw JSON and LIKE-based solutions are much slower. FTS5 (full-text search) offers strong performance and minimal storage, but tag tokenization can cause subtle correctness issues unless carefully managed. The ideal strategy depends on your use case: M2M tables are best for most production apps, FTS5 suits search-oriented interfaces, and lookup tables complement JSON columns for API-centric designs. The benchmark code is available at [benchmark.py](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-tags-benchmark/blob/main/benchmark.py), and FTS5 docs are [here](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html).

**Key Findings:**
- Indexed lookup (JSON+table) and M2M tables: fastest queries, <1.5ms per tag, but higher setup/storage.
- FTS5: 2–3ms queries, lowest storage, but demands careful tag design to avoid tokenization issues.
- Raw JSON (`json_each`) and LIKE: simple to implement, much slower, suitable only for small or occasional queries.
- All strategies handled correctness, but speed and scalability varied dramatically.

### [PDF to Image Converter](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/pdf-to-image-converter#readme) (2026-03-19 21:06)

Leveraging Rust's `pdfium-render` crate and Python's PyO3 bindings, this project enables fast and reliable conversion of PDF pages to JPEG images, packaged as a self-contained Python wheel. The CLI tool and Python library are both built to require no external dependencies, bundling the necessary PDFium binary for ease of installation and cross-platform compatibility. Users can retrieve page counts, render individual pages to byte streams, or batch convert PDFs to images at configurable DPI settings. Architecture is modular, separating the Rust CLI and Python API, with clear mechanisms for library discovery and efficient RGBA-to-RGB image processing.

**Key findings:**
- Self-contained installs: Bundles `libpdfium.so` in wheel, removing dependency headaches.
- Uses [pdfium-render](https://github.com/paulvollmer/pdfium-render) and prebuilt [pdfium-binaries](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries).
- Efficient conversion: JPEG images rendered with robust RGBA→RGB handling.
- Proven on SimpleQA: 14-page PDF converted at 150 DPI as demonstration.

It includes a single JSON file with 206 tests covering base64 encoding, zigzag integer transformations, value conversions, roundtrip integrity, and special numeric values, ensuring correctness across platforms. The suite is accompanied by a TypeScript runner utilizing Vitest and a standalone Python port fully tested via pytest, demonstrating cross-language fidelity and completeness. Both the TypeScript and Python implementations pass all test cases, verifying consistent and reliable encoding and decoding behavior.

**Key features:**
- JSON test suite covers all encoder/decoder edge cases and formats.
- [Python implementation](https://github.com/creationix/rx/tree/main/rx-python) passes all tests as a faithful port.
- TypeScript runner ensures the test suite remains synchronized with the reference implementation.
- Supports advanced encoding features (schemas, pointers, special values).

### [syntaqlite Python Extension in WebAssembly](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/syntaqlite-python-extension#readme) (2026-03-17 16:51)

syntaqlite-python-extension is a Python C extension module that integrates the [syntaqlite](https://github.com/LalitMaganti/syntaqlite) Rust/C SQL toolkit, making high-fidelity SQL parsing, formatting, validation, and tokenization available to Python and Pyodide environments. It wraps syntaqlite's native FFI for both desktop and web, linking against static libraries produced by Rust and employing Emscripten for WASM builds. The extension exposes four key functions—parse, format_sql, validate, and tokenize—enabling error-tolerant parsing, customizable formatting, schema-aware validation (with suggestions), and full tokenization, including whitespace/comments. Rigorous test coverage ensures robustness for various SQL dialect scenarios.

**Key findings and features:**
- Leverages SQLite grammar and tokenizer for high compatibility.
- Provides native wheels and Pyodide-compatible WASM wheels ([Pyodide docs](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) for integration).
- Supports detailed schema validation with "did you mean?" hints.
- Tested across all API functions for diverse use cases and errors.

### [CSRF Protection Demo: Modern Browser-Based Defenses](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/csrf-protection-demo#readme) (2026-03-14 04:34)

Modern browser security now enables robust Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention without requiring tokens. This demo project contrasts a vulnerable FastAPI bank app with a protected version, showcasing how browser-sent headers like `Sec-Fetch-Site` and `Origin` empower servers to automatically reject cross-origin POST requests. By combining server middleware checks (as seen in [Filippo Valsorda's CSRF approach](https://words.filippo.io/csrf/)) with `SameSite` cookies, state-changing attacks are reliably blocked, while legitimate API requests (e.g., curl) still function. This paradigm shift simplifies protection, requiring only a single middleware for all endpoints and leveraging headers that cannot be spoofed by client JavaScript.

**Key findings:**
- CSRF tokens are obsolete for browsers supporting `Sec-Fetch-Site`; [Go 1.25 http.CrossOriginProtection](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#CrossOriginProtection) implements this method.
- Protected endpoints combined with `SameSite` cookies block attacks even if one layer fails (“defense in depth”).
- API clients or cURL are unaffected, since CSRF is a browser-specific threat.
- Headers like `Sec-Fetch-Site` and `Origin` cannot be manipulated by malicious scripts within the browser.

### [v86 exploration](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/v86-exploration#readme) (2026-03-10 15:55)

Exploring the v86 Linux Emulator (see [v86 Linux Emulator tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/v86)), this project evaluates a browser-based Buildroot 2024.05.2 x86 environment with a constrained 39 MB RAM, featuring BusyBox utilities, Lua 5.4.6 scripting, and core text-processing tools. Although it boasts comprehensive shell utilities, file management tools, and basic network utilities (curl, wget, links), actual internet access is unavailable due to the lack of a configured network relay. The platform is suitable for teaching Linux basics, running Lua scripts, or experimenting with text pipelines and system administration, but is limited by single-core emulated hardware, no persistent storage, and absence of modern programming languages or compiler toolchains. Demonstrations confirm reliable Lua and bc scripting, standard Unix command chains, and hashing features.

Key findings:
- **Most useful features:** Lua scripting with sockets, cryptographic hash tools, robust BusyBox pipelines, file management, and basic system utilities.
- **Major limitations:** No internet access, no package management, no compilers (GCC, Make, etc.), and a maximum of 39 MB RAM.
- **Ideal for:** Linux shell tutorials, lightweight scripting, and disposable browser-based experimentation.

### [Luau WebAssembly: Browser Playground + Python wasmtime](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/pluau-wasm-pyodide#readme) (2026-03-09 21:46)

Luau WebAssembly explores compiling the Luau scripting language (used by Roblox) to WebAssembly for interactive browser environments and Python integration via wasmtime. By leveraging Emscripten, the project creates a streamlined WASM module that runs in the browser (with a playground and Pyodide integration) and server-side Python. Key technical adaptations include custom output capture, flexible WASM imports for wasmtime, and Python wrappers that handle C++ exception lifecycles. The result is a compact setup enabling Luau scripts to execute reliably across platforms with minimal performance overhead, without the heavier Rust-based pluau bindings.

**Key findings:**
- Luau compiled to WASM runs efficiently (<1ms eval in browser, ~5ms in Python with wasmtime).
- Custom Emscripten imports allow flexible deployment and simplified C++ exception handling in Python.
- The playground enables sharing code via URL hashes and supports Python/Luau interaction in-browser via Pyodide.
- Compiling Luau VM directly is much simpler than porting the full pluau Rust bindings to WASM.

### [Rust Word Cloud CLI](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/rust-wordcloud#readme) (2026-02-27 19:02)

Leveraging Rust’s performance and safety, this CLI tool generates PNG word clouds directly from text input using a custom spiral layout algorithm and efficient grid-based collision detection. It supports flexible options for image size, font scaling, color schemes, and background colors, with all core features—such as stopword filtering, spatial indexing, and layout—implemented from scratch without any external word cloud library. Designed for usability, it reads from files or stdin and auto-increments output filenames to prevent overwrites. Key image rendering is powered by Rust crates `image` and `ab_glyph` for font handling and PNG output. For further inspiration and algorithmic details, see Max Woolf’s write-up and example project: [Max Woolf’s AI Agent Coding](https://minimaxir.com/2026/02/ai-agent-coding/).

**Key findings:**
- Grid-based spatial indexing enables real-time placement of 200+ densely packed words (O(1) collision checks).
- Logarithmic font scaling avoids overcrowding by dominant words and improves visual balance.
- Spiral placement with random angular offsets yields more natural, less rigid word clouds.

### [Unicode Explorer — Binary Search Over HTTP](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/unicode-explorer-binary-search#readme) (2026-02-27 16:00)

By leveraging HTTP Range requests and fixed-width binary records, Unicode Explorer demonstrates efficient binary search for Unicode data directly from a static file with zero backend or dependencies. The client fetches only one 256-byte record per step, using signposts from `meta.json` to optimize initial narrowing, then performs real-time network-driven binary search, visualized in an interactive log. Each search transfers minimal data and never loads the full 76MB file, showcasing how indexed, record-based search can work entirely over HTTP. The project is available as a live demo and its code can be explored [here](https://github.com/paulgb/unicode-explorer).

**Key Findings:**
- Efficient binary search over large static files is possible using Range requests and fixed-width records.
- Signpost sampling speeds up the initial narrowing of the search range, reducing network requests.
- No server, database, or external JS dependencies are required; the complete search happens in-browser over HTTP.

### [README Timezone Clarification](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/clarify-readme-timezone#readme) (2026-02-22 19:49)

Timezone mismatches in the project’s root README.md were identified due to inconsistent git commit author dates—some in UTC, others in US Pacific time—displayed without timezone clarification. The listing was generated by a cog script that extracted dates using `git log`, then formatted them without standardizing to a common timezone, causing confusion across 39 project directories. To resolve this, the README now includes a note stating all times are in UTC, and the cog script was updated to normalize dates to UTC, ensuring consistent and accurate timestamp display. More on [Git’s date formats](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) and [cog automation tool](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/).

**Key Fixes:**
- All commit times in listings are now shown in UTC.
- README explicitly notes the timezone for clarity.
- Script updated to convert and format all dates as UTC.

### [WebMCP + Chrome DevTools Protocol Demo](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/webmcp-chrome-demo#readme) (2026-02-22 18:20)

WebMCP is a proposed browser API that enables web applications to expose structured, callable tools for AI agents, reducing the need for unreliable UI automation. This project demonstrates how to register and interact with WebMCP tools using a Python client over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), providing a bridge to discover and call these tools programmatically. While WebMCP’s native API allows only for tool registration (not querying or invocation), the demo introduces a custom registry (`window.__webmcp_tools`) to enable CDP-based automation. The approach is complementary to official efforts like [@mcp-b/global](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mcp-b/global) and illustrates how AI agents can reliably manipulate page state through exposed APIs, with all code runnable on Chrome Canary 146+.

Key findings:
- Native WebMCP exposes only registration, unregistration, and context APIs; there is no built-in way to list or invoke tools from external code.
- CDP is leveraged through page script injection to discover and call registered tools programmatically.
- The demo registers seven common tools (e.g., get/set counter, add/delete notes), and workflows are validated end-to-end via headless Chrome and screenshots.
- [WebMCP Spec](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/) provides further technical details.

### [Header Alignment Investigation - simonwillison.net](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/blog-header-alignment#readme) (2026-02-19 21:56)

Addressing a subtle header alignment issue on simonwillison.net, this investigation tracked down a persistent ~1px height mismatch between left and right headers caused by anchor elements generating taller inline boxes than plain text due to font metrics. Multiple fixes—including removing position:relative/top:1px hacks and setting explicit heights—proved fragile. The optimal solution was applying display:flex and align-items:center to the h2.overband headers, normalizing their height regardless of link presence and enabling precise vertical alignment. Padding-top was also adjusted to shift header contents down by user-requested 1–3px. For reproducible testing, the Showboat tool was used for screenshot capture and stepwise CSS live editing ([Showboat](https://github.com/simonw/showboat)).

Key findings:
- Inline anchor tags, even with identical font and line-height, produce taller boxes than plain text, leading to subtle alignment mismatches.
- Legacy position/top hacks provide only imprecise visual compensation and do not solve underlying flow issues.
- Setting display:flex and align-items:center on shared parent header elements reliably normalizes vertical sizing.
- All attempts with explicit heights proved rigid, breaking with font/zoom changes.
- Final CSS is robust across viewport sizes and scaling—see local test screenshots for proof.

### [SQLite Hamming Distance Extension: Scalar vs Virtual Table](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-hamming-extension#readme) (2026-02-17 15:56)

Exploring efficient Hamming distance search in SQLite for binary embeddings, this project implements both a scalar function extension and a virtual table extension as described in ["Hamming Distance for Hybrid Search in SQLite"](https://notnotp.com/notes/hamming-distance-for-hybrid-search-in-sqlite/). The scalar function scans and sorts rows to locate nearest matches, while the virtual table caches embeddings and leverages a max-heap to deliver top-k results up to seven times faster. Benchmarking with 1M embeddings shows the virtual table greatly outperforms the scalar function due to linear, memory-optimized scanning, though it introduces a modest memory overhead and possible staleness if source data changes. The virtual table is ideal for read-heavy workloads where embeddings change infrequently.

Key findings:
- [Scalar extension](https://notnotp.com/notes/hamming-distance-for-hybrid-search-in-sqlite/): ~80ms per search (1M rows), leveraging SIMD popcount.
- Virtual table: ~12ms per top-k query, after initial cache load (~246ms); memory usage ~136MB for 1M rows.
- Primary speedup is from efficient memory layout and cache utilization, not just avoidance of SQL sorting.
- Cache-backed virtual tables must be rebuilt if the embedding table changes; best suited for static/read-mostly use cases.

### [sqlite-chronicle + sqlite-history-json: Same Table Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-chronicle-vs-history-json#readme) (2026-02-15 16:31)

Using both [sqlite-chronicle](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-chronicle) and [sqlite-history-json](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json) on the same SQLite table is feasible, as each library installs its own set of triggers and companion tables without interfering with standard CRUD operations. Chronicle focuses on efficient sync/versioning, while history-json offers a complete audit log, and both operate independently even with compound primary keys or concurrent audit groups. One major pitfall occurs when using `restore(swap=True)` from history-json, which deletes all triggers—including chronicle’s—requiring manual re-enabling to resume tracking. Performance overhead for using both is roughly additive (~2.3x), and behaviors like no-op update detection and handling of INSERT OR REPLACE differ between the libraries.

Key findings:
- Enabling order does not matter; both track changes independently.
- `restore(swap=True)` wipes all triggers—must manually re-enable them after.
- Chronicle provides smarter no-op detection; history-json records every operation.
- Handling of INSERT OR REPLACE depends on SQLite’s `recursive_triggers` setting; history-json may miss implicit deletes unless this is ON.
- Each library can be safely disabled/re-enabled without affecting the other’s tracking.

### [Guidepup Screen Reader Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/guidepup-screenreader-investigation#readme) (2026-02-15 02:03)

An investigation into [Guidepup](https://github.com/guidepup/guidepup) reveals that its core package does not support Linux—only macOS (VoiceOver) and Windows (NVDA). However, two practical methods were proven for generating audio screen reader sessions on Linux: one uses the AT-SPI accessibility stack and Orca to walk a real browser's accessibility tree and synthesize narration; the other employs the [virtual screen reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guidepup/virtual-screen-reader) (pure JS, fast) to simulate navigation, then builds audio from spoken phrases. Approach A offers higher fidelity by testing browser-specific accessibility infrastructure, while Approach B is simpler and ideal for automated testing. Both approaches produce usable audio narration, although neither captures Orca's live speech output directly.

**Key findings:**
- Guidepup cannot currently automate or record Orca sessions on Linux.
- AT-SPI + Orca approach yields realistic accessibility testing but requires complex setup.
- Virtual-screen-reader is fast and deterministic but only simulates behavior.
- Integrating Orca into Guidepup would require significant AT-SPI2 D-Bus work.

### [SeaweedFS 4.12 Feature Testing](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/seaweedfs-testing#readme) (2026-02-13 13:39)

SeaweedFS version 4.12 was evaluated on Linux x86_64, demonstrating its functionality as a scalable distributed file system through its core blob store, filer, S3-compatible, and WebDAV APIs. All-in-one deployment via `weed mini` enables access to web UIs for cluster administration, filer usage, and volume monitoring ([Admin UI screenshot](https://seaweedfs.com)). Testing confirmed seamless file operations across HTTP, S3, WebDAV, including directory management, standard HTTP features, and multiple URL formats. Advanced features such as TTL-based automatic file and volume expiration, collections as namespaces, transparent compression, on-the-fly image resizing, and volume compaction were verified. Replication strategies and data center awareness are available, although higher replication levels require a multi-node cluster.

Key findings:
- SeaweedFS [S3 API](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/tree/master/s3) fully interoperates with AWS CLI for bucket/object management.
- TTL volumes expire and are efficiently deleted, confirming robust lifecycle management.
- Collections and namespace isolation are supported via dedicated volume groups.
- Image resizing and compression occur transparently at the storage/server layer, preserving client simplicity.
- Volume compaction (vacuuming) reclaims space from deleted files as expected.

### [OpenAI Skills API — Hands-On Demo](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/openai-api-skills#readme) (2026-02-11 19:14)

OpenAI's Skills API enables models to execute reusable, self-contained scripts and tools by packaging instructions and code (plus optional assets) with a `SKILL.md` manifest. This project demonstrates crafting a custom skill (“csv-insights”), uploading it via the `/v1/skills` endpoint, and invoking it in natural language through the Responses API’s hosted shell environment, where the model installs dependencies, executes scripts, and returns outputs such as markdown reports and plots. Further, it explores skill management operations like listing, retrieving, version pinning, inline (base64) skills, bundling assets, combining multiple skills, and lifecycle actions like deletion—confirming that skills are easily routable, modular, and production-ready. For details, see [OpenAI Skills API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/skills) and the [Cookbook examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/skills).

Key findings:
- Skills are auto-discovered and routed by models based on their `name` and `description`.
- Skills can be attached via upload (with version pinning) or inline as base64-encoded zips for prototyping.
- Asset bundling within skills allows test data and scripts to travel together, supporting fully self-contained workflows.
- Version must be a string in the API; deletion operations may be subject to eventual consistency.

### [cysqlite WebAssembly Wheel](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/cysqlite-wasm-wheel#readme) (2026-02-10 22:11)

By cross-compiling [cysqlite](https://github.com/coleifer/cysqlite), a high-performance Cython-based SQLite3 binding, to WebAssembly with Emscripten, this project delivers a ready-to-use wheel for [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) that enables rapid, native-like SQLite operations directly in browser-based Python environments. The build pipeline automates all necessary steps, from fetching dependencies to ensuring compatibility with Pyodide 0.25.x (Python 3.11, Emscripten 3.1.46). An included demo page demonstrates functionality and validates integration via more than 115 exhaustive upstream tests, confirming robust performance except for threading-related scenarios. The wheel can be easily integrated into any Pyodide project using micropip, empowering rich client-side data workflows without native modules.

**Key findings:**
- All 115 upstream tests pass (excluding threading and slow tests), confirming high reliability and compatibility.
- Installation and usage in Pyodide rely solely on micropip and require no native dependencies.
- Build process fully automates cross-compilation and wheel generation for Pyodide-compatible deployment.

### [rod-cli: Chrome Automation from the Command Line](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/go-rod-cli#readme) (2026-02-09 19:10)

- Built-in timeout/cancellation controls, event-driven synchronization, and full thread safety for concurrent goroutines.
- Includes utilities for screenshots, PDFs, network hijacking, and exposing Go functions in page JS.

### [krunsh](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool#readme) (2026-02-08 00:11)

Krunsh is a minimal Go CLI tool that executes newline-delimited shell commands inside an ephemeral KVM-based microVM, leveraging the [libkrun](https://github.com/containers/libkrun) library for lightweight virtualization. By piping commands from stdin, krunsh spins up a microVM, runs the specified commands using `/bin/sh -c`, captures the output, and discards the VM afterward, ensuring zero persistent state and strong process isolation. The tool is built upon [libkrun-go](https://github.com/mishushakov/libkrun-go), allowing configurable VMs (CPUs, RAM, root filesystem) and requires a Linux host with KVM support. Extensive nested virtualization tests (including QEMU TCG scenarios) confirm that commands are executed entirely within the microVM environment, not on the host.

**Key highlights:**
- Krunsh creates microVMs per invocation, guaranteeing ephemeral execution and no persistent artifacts.
- Uses host filesystem sharing via virtiofs but allows specifying alternate root filesystems for greater isolation.
- Requires direct KVM access, limiting use in containers or sandboxes without `/dev/kvm`.
- Demonstrates correct CLI-to-libkrun API usage for POSIX shell execution semantics.

### [Monty WASM + Pyodide](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/monty-wasm-pyodide#readme) (2026-02-06 18:05)

Monty WASM + Pyodide explores compiling [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty)—a Rust-based, sandboxed Python interpreter—into WebAssembly for seamless browser access. It provides two integration paths: a standalone WASM module accessible directly from JavaScript, and a Pyodide-compatible wheel for usage in Python-in-the-browser environments. The project enables safe, dependency-free Python code execution with features like variable injection, output capturing (including print statements), and robust error handling. Developers can quickly leverage Monty via simple APIs, as demonstrated in the [live browser demos](https://simonw.github.io/research/monty-wasm-pyodide/demo.html), making in-browser Python useful for education, prototyping, or interactive documentation.

**Key Features and Findings:**
- Two deployment modes: Standalone WASM ES module and Pyodide wheel ([demo links](https://simonw.github.io/research/monty-wasm-pyodide/demo.html), [Pyodide demo](https://simonw.github.io/research/monty-wasm-pyodide/pyodide-demo.html)).
- Supports variable inputs, print output capture, error detection, and returns native JavaScript/Python types.
- Straightforward installation and testing workflows for both WASM and Pyodide contexts.
- Enables secure Python execution in browsers with minimal infrastructure or dependencies.

### [Building PyO3/Maturin Rust Extension Modules as WebAssembly Wheels for Pyodide](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/pyo3-pyodide-wasm#readme) (2026-02-06 15:38)

Compiling Rust-based Python extension modules (via PyO3 and maturin) into WebAssembly wheels for Pyodide involves precise coordination of toolchain versions and build flags to ensure compatibility. The process relies on maturin (≥1.0) for packaging, the Emscripten SDK (with the exact version used by Pyodide), and a Rust nightly toolchain matching Pyodide's ABI, particularly the `-Z emscripten-wasm-eh` flag and a compatible sysroot for Python 3.13 (Pyodide 0.28+). Wheels must be served with correct ABI and platform tags, and can be loaded in Pyodide using `micropip.install()` or `pyodide.loadPackage()` if CORS headers are set. PyPI does not currently support uploading wasm wheels, so alternatives like GitHub Releases are used.

Key tools and references:
- [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3): Rust bindings for Python.

### [just-bash: Deno JSONL Server + Python Client](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/just-bash-deno-python#readme) (2026-02-04 14:47)

Exploring the capabilities of [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash), this project integrates the TypeScript-based bash emulator into a persistent, JSONL-over-stdio server in Deno, accessible via a robust Python client library. The solution enables sandboxed bash scripting with comprehensive built-in commands, a virtual filesystem, and optional network access, with persistent state and fine-grained request control (env, cwd, timeout) supported. The Python package (`just_bash_py`) provides both sync and async interfaces for seamless interaction with the server, supporting advanced bash constructs, file operations, pipelines, and state reset. Extensive testing confirms compatibility for essential scripting tasks, though some components like sqlite3 and yq are limited by Deno-specific constraints. The project serves as a practical foundation for plugin development and AI agent sandboxing, leveraging Deno's flexibility and Python's accessibility.

Key findings:
- [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash) in Deno provides virtualized bash with ~97 commands, persistent state, and network support.
- JSONL protocol ensures reliable client-server communication with UUID tracking and stateful operations.
- [Python client](https://pypi.org/project/just-bash-py/) enables sync/async usage, file manipulation, pipelines, and environment overrides.
- All standard bash scripting and data-wrangling features work; known Deno issues affect sqlite3 and yq functionality.

### [WASM REPL CLI Tools](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/wasm-repl-cli#readme) (2026-02-04 00:27)

WASM REPL CLI Tools enable JavaScript and Python REPLs from the command line by leveraging WebAssembly runtimes in Go, built on the [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) engine. The project supplies separate binaries for each language—one using [QuickJS WASI](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs) and the other CPython WASI—offering direct code execution, interactive shells, and a JSONL mode. JSONL mode lets external applications submit code for execution while maintaining persistent state across requests, facilitating programmatic integration. Although the WASM runtime files must be downloaded separately due to their size, the solution provides robust sandboxed execution, limited filesystem access, and strict isolation for secure evaluation.

**Key features and findings:**
- Supports direct, interactive, and programmatic (JSONL) code evaluation with persistent state.
- Uses persistent process (Python) or code replay (JavaScript) for state retention between requests.
- Relies on WASI for sandboxing, imposing restrictions on networking and threading.
- Integrates with testing frameworks (pytest, uv) for reliability and maintainability.

### [What we learned today about this ChatGPT “container” environment](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/chatgpt-container-environment#readme) (2026-01-26 09:34)

Experiments in the ChatGPT sandbox reveal that general outbound internet access from Python and other user code (such as HTTP requests) is entirely blocked, while package managers like pip and npm are permitted to fetch dependencies using curated internal registry proxies. The container provides a privileged fetching mechanism (`container.download`) for select public URLs, which is more powerful than standard code-based networking. Metadata inspection shows that packages installed through these proxies behave normally and are introspectable via Python standards. While Docker CLI tools are absent, the internal Artifactory proxy allows programmatic access to Docker registry endpoints, highlighting a clear pattern: only curated package egress is supported, not arbitrary web access. Further documentation of internal registry endpoints illustrates broad, multi-language support for curated package downloads, but not unmediated internet access.

**Key findings:**
- Public URLs are retrievable with [container.download](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code/container-download), not with standard code requests.
- All package managers (pip, npm, uvx) rely on internal registry mirrors ([Artifactory endpoints](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/)).
- Arbitrary repository clones (GitHub via git/curl) fail; PyPI source artifacts work instead.
- Docker manifests and blobs can be fetched via registry endpoints, though no Docker runtime exists.
- Registries for Go, Maven, Gradle, Cargo are configured but were not fully tested.
- Practical access to external data is constrained to what registries and container.download allow, enforcing a strong sandbox model.

### [Cloudflare Workers with Python and SQLite](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/cloudflare-workers-python-sqlite#readme) (2026-01-26 09:12)

Exploring the intersection of Cloudflare Workers, Python (via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)), and SQLite persistence, this project demonstrates practical techniques for building serverless applications with both JavaScript and Python runtimes on the Cloudflare platform. JavaScript Workers, paired with D1 for persistent SQLite storage, handled form input, basic routing, and a page view counter. Minimal Python Workers functioned reliably for standard libraries and in-memory SQLite, but advanced frameworks (like Starlette) are blocked locally due to `workerd`'s requirement for direct internet access to fetch external dependencies, stalling use of packages beyond those bundled in Pyodide. The findings aid in understanding [Cloudflare Workers with Python](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/) and the practical limits of local emulation with external dependencies.

**Key Findings:**
- JavaScript Workers easily integrate with D1 for persistent SQLite, with clear database configuration and local dev workflows.
- Pure Python Workers (no external packages) run perfectly locally, including in-memory SQLite.
- Python Workers using external dependencies (e.g., hashlib, Starlette) are blocked without direct internet access; proxy support is not yet available in `workerd`.
- Persistence, routing, and form handling are straightforward in both JavaScript and Python barebones Workers, but richer Python apps require network access for package installation.

### [DuckDB Security Constraints for Untrusted Query Execution](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/duckdb-security#readme) (2026-01-16 19:11)

Evaluating DuckDB’s sandboxing features for secure untrusted query execution, this project demonstrates how to configure read-only access, restrict file and network operations, and enforce query timeouts in Python environments. Native settings like `read_only`, `enable_external_access`, and `allowed_paths` effectively limit users to preapproved data sources, while locking configuration via `lock_configuration=true` ensures that these controls cannot be altered by malicious queries. Since DuckDB does not offer built-in query timeouts, a thread-based workaround using `connection.interrupt()` is verified and recommended. An integrated wrapper, [`sandboxed_duckdb.py`](sandboxed_duckdb.py), encapsulates these protections, serving as a template for running untrusted code safely—further supporting async use cases through [aioduckdb](https://pypi.org/project/aioduckdb/).

**Key findings:**
- DuckDB provides direct support for file/network allowlists, read-only operation, and config locking for robust isolation.
- Limiting external access and predefining allowed files prevents unauthorized data access.
- Resource limits and manual timeouts via connection interruption mitigate denial-of-service and runaway queries.
- No native async API, but third-party solutions like `aioduckdb` exist.

### [String Redaction Library](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/string-redaction-library#readme) (2026-01-13 16:38)

Designed to detect secrets in text, the String Redaction Library leverages statistical analysis of character patterns—such as vowel/consonant ratios and digit presence—rather than relying on specific secret formats or regular expressions. It identifies highly random or non-English-like alphanumeric strings, hashes, and tokens without context awareness, making it easy to scan for hard-to-spot secrets in source code or logs. Developers use a simple API (`detect_secrets`) to obtain positions and values of flagged strings, while cross-language portability is powered by YAML-based test cases. Limitations include reduced effectiveness for natural-looking or short secrets, and optimal performance only for English text. Source and documentation are available at [redactor.py](redactor.py).

**Key findings:**
- Statistical scoring detects secrets like hashes and keys with high accuracy for unusual character patterns.
- CamelCase and normal English words are filtered out, reducing false positives.
- Cross-language test support ensures consistent secret detection when porting the algorithm.  
- No context inspection (e.g., variable names) is used, making the tool language-independent but less contextual.

### [whenwords Esoteric Languages](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/whenwords-esoteric-langs#readme) (2026-01-12 21:21)

Showcasing the versatility of the [whenwords](https://github.com/dbreunig/whenwords) time formatting specification, this project features parallel implementations in three esoteric programming languages: LOLCODE, Rockstar, and WebAssembly Text (WAT). Each version adapts the time formatting logic—such as "3 hours ago" and duration parsing—using the idiomatic constructs and limitations of its language, producing transpiled or compiled code for JavaScript, Python, or a compact WASM binary. All implementations were rigorously tested, passing 98.4% of cases, with minor edge-case discrepancies at month boundaries. Notably, the WAT code is available as a tiny 876-byte WASM with an [interactive playground](https://simonw.github.io/research/whenwords-esoteric-langs/wat/playground.html), making these esoteric implementations accessible for experimentation and learning.

**Key findings/results:**
- All three languages successfully implement core functions (`timeago`, `duration`) as defined in the whenwords spec.
- Testing reveals only two edge-case rounding errors with month calculations.
- The WASM binary is highly compact and includes a demo for hands-on testing.
- Implementation strategies varied to accommodate each language's capabilities and transpiler limitations.

### [pymemchr-c: C Implementation of memchr Library](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/memchr-c-wrapper#readme) (2026-01-05 22:05)

Offering a pure C reimplementation of the Rust-based [pymemchr](https://github.com/BurntSushi/memchr), pymemchr-c delivers high-performance byte and substring search functions to Python with extensive SIMD (SSE2/AVX2/NEON) optimizations and runtime CPU feature detection. Its unique "Packed Pair" substring search algorithm enables the C version to outperform both Python's built-in methods (up to 28x faster) and the original Rust extension (up to 1.5x faster for substring operations), all while removing the need for a Rust toolchain. The library provides a familiar API—including iterator and precompiled finder classes—and can be installed and built with standard Python tooling such as setuptools and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Benchmarks show major speedups for multi-byte and substring search tasks, making pymemchr-c an ideal choice for data-intensive byte and substring manipulation in Python.

**Key Findings:**
- C "Packed Pair" substring search makes pymemchr-c 1.4–1.6x faster than Rust, and up to ~29x faster than Python's native methods.
- Single-byte searches offer modest speedups (1.3–1.6x) over Python, thanks to highly optimized glibc routines.
- Multi-byte searches see 3–9x speedups over Python due to SIMD optimizations.
- Iterator functions and substring iterations are drastically faster in C than both Python and Rust implementations.

### [sqlite3-wasm Investigation Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-wasm-library#readme) (2026-01-05 19:59)

Seeking to enable Python's SQLite interface with WebAssembly, the project developed a `sqlite3_wasm` library—a drop-in replacement for Python's standard `sqlite3` module. By compiling SQLite 3.45.3 to WASM with wasi-sdk and wrapping the resulting binary with a Python API, the solution delivers fully functional, in-memory, WASM-powered database operations using the wasmtime runtime. The implementation passes 60 thorough tests, validating compatibility with core SQLite features while highlighting WASM-specific constraints, such as the absence of user-defined functions and limits on external file access. Packaging was verified with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), confirming that the wheel includes all necessary WASM binaries.

**Key Findings:**
- `sqlite3_wasm` behaves identically to Python's standard `sqlite3` for in-memory databases.
- Integration with [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) enables reliable and fast WASM execution.
- Due to WebAssembly sandboxing, user-defined functions, file-based storage, and trace/progress callbacks are unsupported.
- The wheel contains both Python code and the 1.4MB WASM-compiled SQLite binary, ensuring simple installation and use.

### [pymemchr](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/memchr-python-wrapper#readme) (2026-01-05 19:38)

pymemchr is a Python library that provides ultra-fast byte and substring search functions by binding to the [memchr](https://github.com/BurntSushi/memchr) Rust crate, leveraging SIMD optimizations for superior performance. Using [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) and Maturin for cross-language integration, pymemchr offers efficient routines for finding single bytes, searching for multiple bytes, and locating substring patterns, both forwards and backwards, with highly competitive speedup over native Python methods. It is ideal for processing large data, repeated searches, and performance-critical applications, with precompiled searchers that minimize overhead for repeated queries. Benchmarks show particularly strong gains (up to 20x) in substring and multi-byte search tasks for large datasets.

**Key findings:**
- Single-byte search is up to 1.8x faster than native Python; multi-byte and substring operations can reach 4–20x speedup.
- Precompiled Finder classes enable rapid repeated searches.
- SIMD acceleration covers x86_64, aarch64, wasm32; falls back to scalar methods if unavailable.
- Most beneficial for big data or workloads requiring many search operations.

### [SQLite Time Limit Extension](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-time-limit-extension#readme) (2026-01-03 05:06)

Designed as a Python C extension, the SQLite Time Limit Extension introduces a function, execute_with_timeout, enabling SQL queries against a SQLite database to be terminated if they exceed a specified millisecond threshold. This is achieved using SQLite's progress handler, ensuring that long-running queries do not block application responsiveness. Usage is simple via standard import, and rigorous tests are provided with pytest to validate both normal operation and timeouts. The project is organized for easy development and rapid testing, making it practical for integration into larger Python projects.

### [HTTP Range Requests for Wheel Metadata](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/http-range-wheel-metadata#readme) (2025-12-26 23:29)

Leveraging ZIP file structure and HTTP range requests, tools like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) efficiently extract wheel metadata for Python packages without downloading entire archives. By fetching just the last 16KB of the wheel (central directory and EOCD), parsing for the METADATA file offset, and then requesting exactly its byte range, uv and the accompanying Python prototype routinely reduce bandwidth usage by over 70%. This approach drastically speeds up dependency resolution for large wheels, provided PyPI or the package index supports range requests. In tandem, uv’s innovative packing of PEP 440 version information into a single `u64` integer accelerates version comparisons from O(n) string parsing to fast integer checks, affecting millions of operations during package resolution. Together, these methods showcase how protocol and data structure choices can compound to improve package manager performance.

**Key Findings:**
- Fetching only necessary ZIP sections saves significant bandwidth—typically over 70% per wheel.
- HTTP range request support is prevalent across major Python package repositories.
- Over 90% of PyPI versions fit uv’s compact integer representation, enabling efficient version sorting and comparison.
- Methodology is reproducible in Python (see [wheel_metadata.py](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for relevant tool).

### [Vibium Python Client Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/vibium-python-client#readme) (2025-12-25 13:41)

Examining the [Vibium](https://github.com/VibiumDev/vibium) browser automation project, this investigation developed a Python client library that interoperates with Vibium’s Go-powered "clicker" binary and existing Node.js tools. The Python client exposes both synchronous and asynchronous APIs, replicating advanced browser automation features such as auto-waiting, visibility checks, and custom commands (e.g., `vibium:find`, `vibium:click`) via WebDriver BiDi over WebSocket. This approach leverages Vibium’s architecture: all browser management resides in the single Go binary, while clients like Python and JS interact only through simple JSON messaging. All critical functionality, including navigation, element querying, and action execution, were validated with comprehensive sync and async test cases. Find source and documentation at [Vibium Python Client](https://github.com/VibiumDev/vibium/tree/main/vibium-python).

Key findings:
- Vibium's protocol adds custom commands to standard WebDriver BiDi for actionability and robust auto-wait operations.
- The Python client fully mirrors the Node.js design, enabling seamless integration for AI agents or scripted workflows.
- The Go binary simplifies client development by abstracting browser complexity and supporting both WebSocket API and direct LLM/agent connections via MCP server.

### [Debug: Failed Cog Code Fix](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/debug-failed-fix#readme) (2025-12-25 06:12)

Debugging investigation into why commit 0dcfad4's fix for cog code rendering didn't work. The fix correctly used string concatenation to avoid `-->` in Python strings, but the explanatory comment itself contained the literal `-->` sequence, which closed the HTML comment early. Solution: rewrote the comment to avoid the problematic character sequence.

- Root cause: Python comment on line 121 contained `"-->"` which HTML parser treats as comment terminator
- Fix: Changed comment wording to avoid the literal sequence
- Lesson: When avoiding character sequences, they must be avoided everywhere in raw text including comments

### [Redis JavaScript Module](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/microquickjs-in-redis#readme) (2025-12-25 03:38)

Expanding Redis’s scripting capabilities, the Redis JavaScript Module enables users to execute JavaScript scripts in Redis through the fast, embedded [mquickjs](https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs) engine, paralleling the Lua scripting features but with a JavaScript syntax. This module introduces commands like `JS.EVAL`, `JS.LOAD`, and `JS.CALL`, supporting script execution, caching, and invocation by SHA1 hash, along with native integrations for running Redis commands, logging, and error handling within scripts. The module operates in a constrained memory environment (256KB per script), ensuring embedding viability and security, and leverages the familiar JavaScript environment (ES5), complete with KEYS/ARGV arrays for parameter passing. Installation and integration processes mirror standard Redis module practices, making it accessible for Redis 7.0+ users who want more extensible and expressive scripting options. Source and build instructions are available via the [project repository](https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs).

**Key Features:**
- JavaScript scripting with access to Redis commands via `redis.call` and `redis.pcall`
- Script caching and invocation using SHA1 hashes for efficient reuse (`JS.LOAD`, `JS.CALL`)
- Full support for JavaScript objects, functions, loops, logging, and SHA1 computation within Redis
- Direct compatibility with Redis cluster requirements via KEYS/ARGV patterns
- Easy module build/install for Redis extension with minimal dependencies

### [Browser URL Size Limits Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/url-limits-investigation#readme) (2025-12-23 17:38)

Major browser engines demonstrate significant differences in how they enforce URL length limits. Chromium sets a 2 MB cap at its inter-process communication boundary, rejecting longer URLs when crossing processes. Firefox relies on user-configurable preferences, employing a 1 MB "standard" limit but permitting up to 512 MB in absolute terms, with stricter limits (2,000 characters) for history and bookmarks. WebKit (Safari) places almost no hard restriction, technically permitting URLs as large as ~2 GB per its string implementation, though real-world operational boundaries come from servers, memory, and infrastructure rather than the browser. Tools and source code links include [Chromium's url_constants.h](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/eae506cc8e9b1cd874a63d20d4d006a1428d29ec/url/url_constants.h#L68-L70) and [Firefox's StaticPrefList.yaml](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/blob/20a1fb35a4d5c2f2ea6c865ecebc8e4bee6f86c9/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.yaml).

**Key findings:**
- No unified standard: Each browser enforces limits independently and inconsistently.
- Context-specific: Limits vary depending on whether URLs cross processes, are stored, or parsed.
- Outdated guidance: The longstanding "2KB limit" legend does not apply to modern browsers.
- Ultimate limits are often practical, dictated more by system constraints than browser source code policies.

### [mquickjs Sandbox Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/mquickjs-sandbox#readme) (2025-12-23 15:43)

Exploring [mquickjs](https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs), a highly minimal JavaScript engine, this project rigorously evaluates its suitability as a safe sandbox for running untrusted code. Various integration approaches are implemented, including Python FFI, C extensions, subprocess invocation, and WebAssembly runtimes—each tested for startup and execution performance, security isolation, and feature compatibility. The investigation finds mquickjs's strict memory and execution time limits effectively minimize risk, and its restricted runtime (no file/network APIs) bolsters safety in hostile environments. While FFI and C extension interfaces yield microsecond-level execution suitable for interactive workloads, WebAssembly runtimes like [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) offer platform-agnostic isolation at the cost of much slower startup. mquickjs's ES5-like dialect lacks newer JavaScript features but remains sufficient for most sandboxed uses.

Key findings:
- FFI and C Extension deliver near-native performance, with C Extension starting ~4x faster.
- Subprocess wrapper is simple but 500x slower due to process spawning.
- WASM runtimes (wasmtime) enhance isolation but are 300–900x slower than native bindings.
- Regex DoS is mitigated via time limits; still, pre-validation is recommended.
- For most workloads, FFI is preferred; WASM/wasmtime best for environments requiring strong sandboxing or portability.

### [Claude Code for Web Environment](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/environment-report#readme) (2025-12-22 23:54)

Running Claude Code on the web offers developers a versatile coding sandbox on Ubuntu 24.04, leveraging a broad toolkit that includes Python 3.11, Node.js 22, Go, Rust, and more, alongside developer utilities (Git, Make) and database clients (SQLite, PostgreSQL). The environment is secured and isolated via gVisor, restricting network features, system-level controls, and kernel interactions, but enabling safe code execution and containerization with Docker—albeit without standard bridging or outbound container networking. Notably, creative workarounds like a Unix socket proxy enable HTTP connectivity for containers despite strict network isolation. For details on Docker workarounds and proxy scripts, see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) and the project's [sample proxy implementation](https://github.com/anthropic/claude-code-web-proxy) (example).

Key findings:
- All major languages and dev tools are pre-installed; supports scripting, code builds, and limited database use.
- Docker works with volume mounts and image builds, but containers lack internet by default.
- Security isolation via gVisor restricts networking, service management, and kernel features.
- Unix socket proxies can be used to relay HTTP requests for network-isolated containers.

### [Litestream S3 Replication Experiments](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/litestream-restarts#readme) (2025-12-17 04:30)

Experiments in this project evaluate Litestream’s robustness when SQLite writes occur while Litestream is stopped and later restarted, with focus on replication to S3. Both the simple restart and the scenario where the WAL is checkpointed (truncated) while Litestream is offline confirm no data loss: Litestream either streams pending WAL changes upon restart or detects a database change and uploads a new full snapshot (“generation”). This ensures that S3 replication remains consistent even if Litestream’s process is interrupted, making the tool highly reliable in dynamic environments. Detailed mechanisms and generations can be inspected using [Litestream’s CLI](https://litestream.io/guides/cli/) and the generation listing feature.

Key findings:
- No data loss occurs in either restart or checkpoint scenarios—Litestream recovers via WAL streaming or generation snapshots.
- Creating new generations after checkpointing uploads the entire database, potentially incurring significant storage/bandwidth overhead for large files.
- Frequent restarts with heavy write loads can increase S3 storage due to more generations.
- Litestream’s fallback mechanisms support safe replication during container restarts, server maintenance, or deployment updates.

### [Can BeautifulSoup Use JustHTML as a Parser?](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/bs4-justhtml-investigation#readme) (2025-12-16 20:27)

BeautifulSoup 4 can be integrated with [JustHTML](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml), a pure Python HTML5 parser, enabling full compliance with the HTML5 parsing algorithm according to the WHATWG specification. By implementing a custom `JustHTMLTreeBuilder`, BeautifulSoup’s parser plugin system can leverage JustHTML for parsing, allowing seamless use of BeautifulSoup’s familiar API and features—like `find_all()` and CSS selectors—while inheriting robust, standards-adherent HTML handling. The integration correctly supports HTML5 implicit element insertion, malformed HTML recovery, and other advanced features. Comprehensive tests confirm that all major parsing and API elements function as expected, making this pairing a practical choice for strict HTML5 parsing within Python.

**Key Findings:**
- All major BeautifulSoup features work (including CSS selectors and handling of malformed HTML)
- Implicit HTML5 element insertion behaves per spec (e.g., auto-created `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Developed a reusable integration module: `bs4_justhtml.py`
- Full details and code at [JustHTML](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml)

### [Streaming File Upload Prototype](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/streaming-file-upload-prototype#readme) (2025-12-14 20:17)

Demonstrating efficient large file uploads, this prototype integrates the [streaming-form-data](https://github.com/siddhantgoel/streaming-form-data) library with a Starlette-based ASGI server to enable true streaming of multipart file data directly to disk, bypassing memory bottlenecks. It incrementally parses incoming form data and supports checksum calculation on-the-fly, handling multiple simultaneous file uploads via async workflows. The included test suite validates robust performance across scenarios including large files, chunked uploads, and multiple files. This architecture makes file handling scalable for production environments, with extensibility for further enhancements such as file size limits and external storage targets.

**Key Findings:**
- Streaming upload prevents memory exhaustion and improves performance for large files.
- Checksum is computed during upload—eliminating the need for a post-upload scan.
- Multiple files can be uploaded in one request; all endpoints are fully ASGI compatible.
- See [streaming-form-data documentation](https://streaming-form-data.readthedocs.io/) for further integration options.

### [Automatic JavaScript API Tagging for simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/js-api-tagger#readme) (2025-12-14 02:14)

Efficiently categorizing the 155 HTML tools in [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools) by their JavaScript API usage, this project developed an automated pipeline combining [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) for HTML parsing and [Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) for JavaScript AST analysis. The solution robustly filters out false positives from comments, strings, and non-code regions, accurately tagging over 60 Web APIs and handling modern ES modules and edge script types. Beyond API detection, the system analyzes external libraries, HTML structure, accessibility, interaction patterns, and data handling, providing multidimensional insight into each tool’s capabilities and design. Results show frequent use of APIs like Fetch, Clipboard, and localStorage, common libraries such as Pyodide and Marked, and a dominant pattern of utilities and file processors among the tools.

**Key findings:**
- Fetch API, Clipboard API, and localStorage are among the most widely used JS APIs.
- CDN sources like jsdelivr and cloudflare are common for library loading.
- Pyodide for Python, Marked for Markdown, and React for UI are notable detected libraries.
- Most tools fall into categories such as utility, clipboard handler, or file processor.

### [Browser-Based Single File Bundler](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/vite-wasm-browser-compiler#readme) (2025-12-14 01:00)

Investigating the feasibility of Vite as a browser-based bundler, this project demonstrates that while Vite itself cannot operate directly in the browser due to its Node.js dependencies, client-side file bundling is achievable using alternative strategies. Three approaches were prototyped: a pure JavaScript "simple" bundler for inlining assets, an esbuild-wasm browser integration for ES module support, and full Vite bundling via StackBlitz WebContainers using vite-plugin-singlefile. Each solution offers a different tradeoff between capability, speed, and complexity, with WebContainers standing out for its completeness but requiring Cross-Origin Isolation headers. The project includes live demos, automated Playwright tests, and step-by-step integration of core technologies such as [esbuild-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-wasm) and [Vite Single File Plugin](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile).

**Key Findings:**
- Vite cannot run purely in-browser; heavy Node.js APIs and native integrations block direct use.
- esbuild-wasm and @rollup/browser enable ES module bundling client-side but are less performant and require HTTP-based module plugins.
- StackBlitz WebContainers offer full Node.js/Vite support in-browser, achieving identical output to local builds.
- The simple bundler is fastest and most portable but lacks ES module support; WASM-based approaches are slower but more capable.

### [AST-Grep Import Rewriter](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/ast-grep-import-rewriter#readme) (2025-12-11 15:50)

Leveraging [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) and custom YAML rules, the AST-Grep Import Rewriter offers a structured approach to automatically extract, analyze, and rewrite obfuscated JavaScript import statements across ES6, CommonJS, dynamic imports, and webpack bundles. By parsing source files, it generates mapping templates and applies user-defined mappings, converting unreadable module paths into meaningful names with either regex- or AST-based transformations. Featuring a command-line interface, the tool integrates with Python and ast-grep CLI, ensuring accurate code rewriting and comprehensive import discovery. Limitations include restricted support for runtime-evaluated imports and complex obfuscations, but the workflow simplifies code cleanup and migration in modern JS projects.

Key features:
- Supports multiple import styles (ES6, CommonJS, dynamic, webpack, re-exports).
- Generates and applies JSON mapping files for path deobfuscation.
- Provides both regex and AST-guided transformation options.
- Includes rules and config for direct use with [ast-grep scan](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/cli.html#scan-command).
- Handles webpack-specific patterns automatically.

### [Offline Notes Sync System](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/offline-notes-sync#readme) (2025-12-11 02:13)

Building on offline-first principles, this notes sync system enables robust note creation and editing without active internet connectivity, using IndexedDB and service workers on the client side. It employs operation-based sync and vector clocks for fine-grained conflict detection and resolution, and features a three-way character-level merge algorithm inspired by Apple Notes. Server-side logic is powered by Python Starlette and SQLite, with advanced CRDT constructs ensuring that concurrent edits from multiple clients merge seamlessly and converge correctly. A Datasette plugin extends API access and automates database table management, facilitating both testing and integration.  
Explore the [CRDT module](crdt.py) and [Datasette plugin](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-notes-sync) for key architectural components.

**Key Findings:**
- Achieves automatic, character-level merging for non-overlapping edits; overlaps prompt user intervention.
- CRDT implementation ensures commutativity, associativity, idempotency, and convergence of all note states.
- Test suite confirms sync, merge, offline persistence, and conflict-handling behavior across edge cases.

### [Epsilon Python Wrapper](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/epsilon-python-wrapper#readme) (2025-12-09 09:47)

Epsilon Python Wrapper provides seamless Python bindings to [Epsilon](https://github.com/ziggy42/epsilon), Google's pure Go WebAssembly 2.0 runtime, enabling efficient and dependency-free WASM execution within Python projects. The wrapper exposes a simple API for module instantiation, function calls (with type safety), memory operations, and export inspection, supporting advanced features like SIMD and resource limiting. While it allows for configurable memory restrictions and function timeouts, true execution interruption (context cancellation or instruction counting) is not supported; thus, alternative CPU limiting strategies are suggested. Epsilon prioritizes clean architecture, zero external dependencies, and ease of embedding, making it a practical choice for Python users needing Go-native WASM capabilities but does not offer WASI or multi-threading.

Key points:
- Enables direct loading, calling, and memory manipulation of WASM modules from Python.
- Supports WebAssembly 2.0—including SIMD, multiple memories (experimental), and host functions.
- Resource limits: configurable memory per module; fixed call stack (1000 frames); no preemptive timeout or instruction counting.
- For CPU/time limiting, subprocesses or system-level approaches are recommended.
- Inspired by projects like [wazero-python](https://github.com/user/wazero-python), but focused on Epsilon's Go-native strengths.

### [Datasette-lite JavaScript Initialization: Problem Analysis & Solution Proposal](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/datasette-lite-js-init#readme) (2025-12-08 04:02)

Datasette-lite faces a core limitation: HTML content injected via `innerHTML` does not execute embedded JavaScript, breaking interactive features and plugin functionality. The proposed solution introduces a standardized initialization event (`datasette_init`) triggered after each content update, allowing dependent scripts and plugins to reinitialize reliably. This approach uses a public API (`window.__DATASETTE_INIT__`) that can target specific DOM containers and signal reinitialization, ensuring clean-up between navigations and preserving backwards compatibility. By aligning with Datasette's event-driven JavaScript architecture, the solution enables smooth operation both in classic and single-page environments like Datasette-lite, with minimal code changes for plugin authors. Prototype files, example integration code, and migration guidelines are provided ([datasette-lite](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite), [Datasette core](https://github.com/simonw/datasette)).

**Key Findings:**
- Reinitialization event pattern solves SPA script execution.
- Plugins must scope DOM queries to injected content and handle clean-up.
- Solution does not require risky manual script eval or iframes.
- Maintains full compatibility with existing Datasette usage.
- Offers a clear migration strategy for plugin developers.

### [Datasette Lite NPM Package Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/datasette-lite-npm-package#readme) (2025-12-08 03:58)

Converting [Datasette Lite](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite) into a self-hostable NPM package enables seamless client-side data exploration using SQLite, CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly in the browser, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). The project removes analytics, adds a CLI server for local testing, and exposes all necessary static assets for easy deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Users can install the package, start a local server, and deploy the static build, making advanced Python-powered data analysis accessible without backend infrastructure. The package also supports various URL parameters to customize data sources and package installation.

**Key findings:**
- Analytics were stripped for privacy and universality.
- Node.js CLI server allows simple local testing with proper CORS.
- The package is lightweight (~13 KB) and quick to deploy, though initial loads depend on Pyodide CDN availability.
- Extensive URL parameters offer flexible data loading and customization.

### [SQLite Ripgrep Function](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-ripgrep-function#readme) (2025-12-07 19:22)

SQLite Ripgrep Function enables fast code and text search inside SQLite queries by integrating the powerful [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search tool as a custom SQL function. It offers both a pure Python implementation and a performant C extension, allowing users to search files within a configurable directory, restrict output with glob patterns (e.g., `*.py`), and enforce time limits to avoid runaway queries. While the Python version returns JSON for lightweight use, the C extension provides true table-valued virtual tables for flexible SQL integration, supporting constraints and column selection directly in queries. This project draws inspiration from [datasette-ripgrep](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep) and is installable in both Python and SQLite environments.

**Key features:**
- Direct code/text search from SQL using ripgrep
- Configurable base directory and file filtering via glob patterns
- Time limit enforcement to prevent slow queries
- Both JSON (Python) and table-valued (C extension) results suitable for further SQL querying
- Easy integration with both Python and SQLite CLI environments

### [Apptron Analysis Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/apptron-analysis#readme) (2025-12-05 21:58)

By tightly integrating VS Code, a Linux terminal, and persistent cloud storage via Cloudflare R2, users are able to work on customizable environments without any local setup. Notably, the Linux guest can execute WASM binaries as first-class executables, and all cloud resources—including storage—are managed with POSIX-like filesystem semantics. The stack is built atop Wanix, an open-source Plan 9-inspired OS layer for WebAssembly, ensuring files and processes are accessible and controllable through uniform filesystem protocols. Learn more at [tractordev/apptron](https://github.com/tractordev/apptron) and [Wanix](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix).

Key findings:
- Bidirectional cloud-browser communication enables seamless VS Code and Linux integration.
- WASM binaries run transparently inside the Linux VM, leveraging novel binfmt_misc and 9P-based IPC.
- Cloudflare R2 serves as a full-featured, metadata-rich filesystem rather than simple object storage.
- Highly customizable environments are supported, with persistent and synced storage.
- Plan 9-inspired filesystem protocols unify resource access and control for all environment layers.

### [GitHub CLI API Proxy Investigation](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/github-cli-api-proxy#readme) (2025-11-29 23:12)

Proxying GitHub CLI (`gh`) API traffic can be achieved through standard HTTP/HTTPS proxies or via a Unix domain socket, each suited to different use cases and levels of flexibility. The CLI, implemented in Go, natively supports proxy environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`), making integration with existing HTTP proxies seamless and requiring no changes to the CLI configuration. For advanced needs like local debugging or custom proxy logic, routing traffic through a Unix domain socket is supported via a configuration option and allows for fine-grained control over requests. Changing the target host (using `GH_HOST`) is not a proxy method but useful for connecting to GitHub Enterprise Server.

Key tools and references:
- [GitHub CLI source code](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- [go-gh library](https://github.com/cli/go-gh)

**Key Findings:**
- Standard proxy integration is easiest (environment variable configuration).
- Unix socket proxying offers advanced flexibility for development, debugging, and custom logic.
- Changing `GH_HOST` allows targeting GitHub Enterprise Server, but does not act as a proxy.
- Example proxy servers (HTTP/HTTPS proxy and Unix socket proxy) are provided for inspection and debugging scenarios.

### [Self-Hosting Datasette Lite: Research Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/self-host-datasette-lite#readme) (2025-11-28 12:01)

Datasette Lite, a browser-based SQLite explorer powered by Pyodide and WebAssembly, can be fully self-hosted and used offline by bundling all core files, required Python wheels, and optional sample databases locally instead of relying on external CDNs and PyPI hosts. Achieving this involves downloading Pyodide's core runtime, all necessary wheels for Datasette and its dependencies, modifying key paths in `webworker.js` and `index.html`, and ensuring correct server MIME settings for .wasm files. The minimal offline bundle is around 20–25 MB, while a full Pyodide distribution increases this to about 350 MB and enhances extensibility. Careful dependency resolution and version pinning are needed to avoid runtime conflicts, and users should provide their own databases or include local samples.

**Key findings:**
- Minimal offline bundles (~25 MB) are practical; full Pyodide versions enable more flexibility at a storage cost.
- Dependency wheels must be manually downloaded and installed in correct order; version mismatches (e.g. in httpx) can cause issues.
- [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) supports custom hosting, but index paths and MIME types require adjustment ([Pyodide GitHub Issue #4600](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4600)).
- Sample server scripts and static analysis tools help automate the bundling and local hosting process.

### [Datasette 1.0a20 SQL Permissions System: Architecture Review](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/datasette-sql-permissions-review#readme) (2025-11-27 18:02)

A comprehensive architecture review of Datasette's new SQL-based permissions system (introduced in v1.0a20) finds that transitioning from a callback-driven model to SQL query resolution greatly improves scalability for large deployments. The redesigned system efficiently checks access by evaluating compiled permission rules through internal catalog tables, substantially reducing processing overhead compared to the multiplicative N x M callback pattern. Despite this advancement, the review highlights that much of the core logic, especially in `default_permissions.py`, has grown complex and difficult to maintain—making it prone to subtle bugs, particularly around interactions between config-based permissions and actor restrictions. Recommendations include refactoring for clarity, improving documentation and debugging tools (see the new [debug endpoints](https://datasette.io/docs/permissions)), and adding early validation for config errors. The SQL query construction approach is effective but would benefit from more declarative abstractions and rigorous parameter handling.

**Key Findings:**
- Major performance improvements, but implementation complexity is high—especially for config/actor restriction interplay.
- Risk of configuration confusion and subtle permission bugs; documentation and validation are critical.
- Debugging and auditability can be enhanced with new endpoints and clearer error messages ([permission system tools](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-debug-permissions)).
- Consistent use of parameterized queries is recommended to prevent SQL injection.
- Refactoring and codifying type hints/utilities would improve long-term maintainability.

### [SQLite-utils Iterator Support Research](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-utils-iterator-support#readme) (2025-11-22 01:04)

Enhancements to the [sqlite-utils](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils) library now allow its `insert_all` and `upsert_all` methods to efficiently process Python iterators yielding lists, in addition to the original dict-based input. Detection of the iterator type is automatic and maintains full backward compatibility, streamlining bulk inserts from row-based data sources like CSV streams and reducing memory usage by avoiding dict construction. Performance benchmarks show list mode delivers up to 21.6% speed improvement for datasets with few columns, though gains diminish or reverse with wider tables. All 1001 existing tests pass, alongside 10 new tests for list mode, confirming robust and production-ready implementation.

**Key findings:**
- List mode is up to 21.6% faster for typical (5-10 column) datasets; dict mode regains advantage for 15+ columns.
- Memory usage drops for list mode due to lack of dict overhead.
- No breaking changes or new dependencies introduced; backwards compatibility is ensured.
- [sqlite-utils-list-mode.diff](sqlite-utils-list-mode.diff) provides the implementation patch.

### [SVG to PNG Renderer](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/svg-to-png-renderer#readme) (2025-11-17 00:21)

A lightweight SVG to PNG renderer has been developed using Python, leveraging the `xml.etree.ElementTree` and `Pillow` libraries to parse SVG XML data and convert it to raster PNG images. This minimal library supports a range of SVG elements, including paths, basic shapes, and containers, as well as attributes such as colors, styling, and transforms. The renderer can be used as a command-line tool or imported as a library, and has been tested with complex SVG files, including the "Ghostscript Tiger" SVG. For more information on the project, see the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) documentation or the [SVG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/).

* Key features:
  * Support for SVG paths, basic shapes, and containers
  * Support for colors, styling, and transforms
  * Can be used as a command-line tool or imported as a library
  * Tested with complex SVG files, including the "Ghostscript Tiger" SVG

### [SVG to PNG Conversion Methods in Python](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/svg-to-png-comparison#readme) (2025-11-17 00:21)

Multiple Python-based approaches for converting SVG files to PNG were benchmarked using the [tiger.svg](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/aedecb93564af13ac1596810d40cac3c/raw/83e7f3be5b65bba61124684700fa7925d37c36c3/tiger.svg) image, evaluating file size, output quality, and ease of installation. Pure Python solutions like [CairoSVG](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG) and svglib+reportlab offered simple pip-based installs with predictable PNGs, though svglib lacks alpha channel support. Wand (ImageMagick bindings) and ImageMagick CLI yielded the highest quality output (16-bit RGBA) at the cost of larger files and system-level dependencies. In contrast, rsvg-convert CLI stood out for speed and batch suitability, while Pillow+CairoSVG enabled further in-Python image manipulation. Ultimately, selection depends on priorities—portability (CairoSVG, svglib), maximal quality (Wand, ImageMagick), minimal footprint (svglib), or performance (rsvg-convert).

Key findings:
- svglib+reportlab produced the smallest files, but without alpha (RGB only).
- Wand and ImageMagick CLI generated 16-bit PNGs, twice the size of other methods.
- CairoSVG remains the simplest, most widely compatible pure Python solution.
- rsvg-convert CLI is fastest for batch or server-side use but needs system install.

### [Absurd-in-SQLite](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/absurd-in-sqlite#readme) (2025-11-12 14:23)

Durable execution workflows can be implemented using SQLite, as demonstrated by the Absurd-in-SQLite project, which is inspired by Armin Ronacher's Absurd. This project provides a proof-of-concept implementation of durable execution using SQLite, allowing for reliable and long-running workflows that can survive crashes and network failures. The project utilizes a pull-based model, where workers pull tasks from a queue, and features a replay model that replays the entire function from the beginning when a task resumes. For more information, visit the [Absurd](https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd) and [Absurd Workflows](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/11/3/absurd-workflows/) resources.

* Key findings:
  * Durable execution can be achieved using a database like SQLite
  * The replay model allows for reliable execution of tasks
  * A pull-based model can simplify workflow management
  * SQLite can handle moderate workloads, but Postgres may be more suitable for high-concurrency scenarios

### [yt-dlp[default] Installation Analysis](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/yt-dlp-install-report#readme) (2025-11-12 13:17)

A detailed analysis of installing `yt-dlp[default]` via pip on Linux with Python 3.11 reveals that the process brings in six new packages totaling about 39 MB and over 3,000 files, including 44 binary libraries (mainly for cryptography and compression) consuming 8.55 MB. The main package, yt-dlp, is a feature-rich video downloader whose full capabilities rely on its optional dependencies, enabled by the `[default]` extra: Brotli (compression), pycryptodomex (cryptography), websockets (live streaming), mutagen (metadata), and yt-dlp-ejs (JavaScript extractors). The installation is dominated by Python source and bytecode files, with binaries used for performance-critical tasks; all binaries are standard Linux ELF shared objects with typical system dependencies. For downloading encrypted content, handling compression, live streams, or audio metadata, installing with `[default]` is recommended.  
Key tools: [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [pycryptodomex](https://www.pycryptodome.org/)

**Key findings:**
- 6 packages installed, major size contributor is yt-dlp itself (~22 MB).
- 44 compiled .so binaries (mostly for crypto/compression, not full executables).
- `[default]` extra adds significant functionality for encrypted, compressed, live, and tagged media.
- Binaries built for standard x86-64 Linux, depending only on common system libraries.

### [UV Run Flow Analysis: Deep Dive into `uv run myscript.py`](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/uv-run-flow-analysis#readme) (2025-11-10 18:35)

Running `uv run myscript.py` in a directory with a `pyproject.toml` launches a multi-phase workflow that automates Python script execution within an isolated, dependency-managed environment. uv scans for project metadata, resolves and validates interpreter and package requirements, manages virtual environments, locks dependencies with a TOML-based `uv.lock` file using the PubGrub algorithm, efficiently syncs the environment with parallel downloads and caching, and finally executes the desired command with robust error handling. This process is orchestrated via performant Rust crates, resulting in fast, reliable, and reproducible Python executions superior to traditional tools like pip or poetry. For more details on the tool, see [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or the PubGrub [resolution algorithm](https://docs.rs/pubgrub/latest/pubgrub/).

Key findings:
- uv automatically discovers and parses project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`, supporting PEP standards and custom configurations.
- Dependency resolution is lock-file-driven (universal, reproducible) and faster than pip/poetry due to Rust implementation, PubGrub, and aggressive caching.
- Python interpreter management is integrated, with automatic downloads and validation against project constraints.
- Installation of packages occurs in a virtual environment, with fine-grained error handling and atomic operations.
- The architecture enables cross-platform consistency, incremental sync, and seamless user experience with zero configuration required.

### [env86 Analysis Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/env86-analysis#readme) (2025-11-10 01:42)

env86 is a Go-based management tool that enables users to run x86 Linux virtual machines within browser contexts via the v86 WebAssembly emulator. By combining a native desktop application (embedding a browser), a robust CLI, and an integrated virtual networking stack, env86 provides an easily distributable and reproducible Linux environment that can boot instantly from snapshots, support host-guest communication, and mount host filesystems.

### [LLM Pyodide OpenAI Plugin](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/llm-pyodide-openai-plugin#readme) (2025-11-09 20:59)

Leveraging the [LLM Python package](https://llm.datasette.io/) and pyodide, this project successfully adapts LLM’s OpenAI model interface for direct use in browser environments by bypassing the standard openai library (which fails in browsers due to its httpx dependency) and instead using the browser-native fetch API for CORS-compliant API calls. The plugin implements the LLM `KeyModel` interface and registers new models with OpenAI support through custom hooks, allowing prompt execution and chat completions entirely within pyodide’s async event loop, without server-side Python. No changes to LLM’s core were required; all adaptations reside in the plugin, which integrates cleanly with the browser’s JS-Python bridge and achieves dynamic model registration, API calls, and response parsing directly in the browser. For reference, the core plugin implementation is contained in `llm_pyodide_openai.py` while [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) provides the Python-in-browser runtime.

**Key findings:**
- The openai package installs in pyodide but is incompatible with browser HTTP requests, necessitating direct fetch API integration.
- All plugin logic, including API calls and response parsing, operates in Python via pyodide, using JavaScript interop for networking.
- No modifications to the LLM core package are required; plugin flexibility is sufficient for adapting to browser constraints.
- Streaming (partial responses) is not yet implemented, but could be achieved with ReadableStream and async generators.
- CORS restrictions are resolved naturally by using fetch, making production-grade browser-based AI agents feasible.

### [OpenAI Codex CLI Sandbox Implementation Analysis](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/codex-sandbox-investigation#readme) (2025-11-09 18:40)

OpenAI Codex CLI's sandbox employs strong, platform-specific isolation to securely constrain the behavior of AI-driven code agents. On macOS, it uses Apple's Seatbelt sandbox with finely tuned dynamic policies, while on Linux, it combines Landlock for strict filesystem controls and seccomp for syscall-based network blocking—ensuring that agents can only write to user-approved directories and have no outgoing network by default. Both platforms feature special protection for `.git` repositories, path canonicalization to thwart symlink attacks, and enforce least-privilege principles, all integrated with user-configurable approval policies for flexibility. Key tools include the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) and related [sandbox documentation](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/sandbox.md).

**Key findings:**
- Codex's sandbox distinguishes between DangerFullAccess (no sandbox), ReadOnly, and WorkspaceWrite modes, tightly controlling file/network access.
- Version control metadata (e.g., `.git`) is always read-only, preventing AI from corrupting repositories.
- Linux sandboxing requires kernel 5.13+ for Landlock; macOS relies on built-in Seatbelt.
- All attempted network operations are blocked at the syscall level, except for local IPC.
- Windows support is experimental; robust isolation is limited outside macOS/Linux.

### [SQLite Query Linter](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-query-linter#readme) (2025-11-05 06:25)

The SQLite Query Linter is a lightweight Python library that wraps the standard `sqlite3` module to provide configurable linting and rule-based analysis of SQL queries before execution. Acting as a drop-in replacement, it helps catch common syntax errors and platform incompatibilities—such as invalid types in `CAST`, use of unsupported functions, `SELECT *`, missing `WHERE` clauses, and string quoting mistakes—helping developers avoid runtime errors and improve code quality. Users can choose built-in rules, set severity levels, and easily define custom rules via an extensible API. Designed for flexibility, it can block execution on critical issues or run in permissive/audit-only modes, with zero dependencies other than Python's standard library. Explore code and integration options at [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/sqlite-query-linter) or view usage in the included [`demo.py`](demo.py) script.

- Flexible configuration: Enable/disable rules, set strictness, and use audit-only monitoring
- Easy to extend for custom organizational or project rules
- Applicable to development, automated testing, database migrations, and production monitoring

### [H3 Library Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/h3-library-benchmark#readme) (2025-11-04 19:07)

A systematic performance benchmark was conducted on two prominent Python libraries implementing Uber's H3 geospatial indexing system: [h3-py](https://github.com/uber/h3-py) (official, C-based) and [h3o-python](https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o) (Rust-based). Results show h3o-python consistently outperforms h3-py on core operations, achieving over 2x speedup for coordinate conversions and up to 13x faster neighbor queries, while area calculations remain comparable. The performance advantage holds steady across varied dataset sizes and H3 resolutions, suggesting h3o-python's Rust backend is highly optimized for geospatial workloads. Differences in API coverage and cell representation (string vs. integer) should inform choice based on project requirements.

**Key Findings:**
- h3o-python is 2.2x faster for coordinate-to-cell and 1.8–2x for cell-to-coordinate conversions.
- Neighbor queries with grid_disk are 10–13x faster in h3o-python.
- Both libraries perform similarly for cell area calculations.
- h3-py offers more features and broader API support; h3o-python excels in raw speed for core operations.

### [h3o-python](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/h3o-python#readme) (2025-11-03 21:34)

h3o-python delivers efficient Python bindings for the [h3o](https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o) Rust library, enabling fast and convenient access to H3 geospatial indexing from Python. Utilizing [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) and packaged with maturin, it allows encoding geographic coordinates into 64-bit H3 cell indexes, decoding indexes, performing neighborhood queries, calculating great-circle distances, and retrieving surface area metrics—all without requiring a separate H3 installation. The module bundles its Rust extension in the distributable wheel for seamless deployment, and the API mirrors the upstream Rust crate for high performance and compatibility.

**Key capabilities:**
- Simple conversion between latitude/longitude and H3 cell indexes
- Neighborhood and adjacency checks, and disk queries
- Accurate area and distance calculations using H3 algorithms
- Lossless string/integer conversions of H3 indexes

### [Wazero Python Bindings](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/wazero-python-claude#readme) (2025-11-02 18:01)

Wazero Python Bindings enable seamless integration of the [wazero](https://wazero.io/) WebAssembly runtime—written in Go—with Python applications, delivering a zero-dependency solution for running WASM modules natively from Python. The project exposes a clean, Pythonic API for instantiating modules, calling exported WASM functions, and managing resources efficiently with context managers. Performance benchmarks demonstrate rapid execution and minimal overhead between Python and WASM. While the library excels at speed and ease of use, current limitations include support only for integer argument and return types, restricted WASI features, and lack of direct memory access.

Key findings:
- Near-native performance for compute-intensive WebAssembly code via [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero).
- Simple Python interface with automatic resource management and no external dependencies.
- Presently limited to i32/i64 arguments/results and basic WASM module features; WASI filesystem and direct memory access are not available yet.

### [Blog Tag Prediction with Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/blog-tags-scikit-learn#readme) (2025-10-24 15:15)

Automatically assigning meaningful tags to historic, untagged blog posts, this project leverages the [Simon Willison blog database](https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog.db) and scikit-learn to train and compare multi-label text classification models. Four approaches—TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and LinearSVC—were tested on posts’ title and body text using the 158 most frequently used tags. LinearSVC, with probability calibration, yielded the best overall performance, striking a balance between precision (85%) and recall (56%) with an F1 score of 68%, proving especially effective for assigning multiple tags to each entry. This [open-source toolkit](https://scikit-learn.org/) not only automates metadata enrichment but facilitates rapid quality assessment and scalable tag prediction for content libraries.

**Key findings:**
- LinearSVC outperformed other models, delivering the highest F1 score (0.6791) and recall.
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest prioritized precision but were more conservative—missing more actual tags.
- Naive Bayes offered a fast, simple solution with a solid balance of metrics.
- TF-IDF features and OneVsRest multi-label strategies proved robust for text classification in high-dimensional spaces.

### [cmarkgfm in Pyodide - ✅ WORKING!](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/cmarkgfm-in-pyodide#readme) (2025-10-22 23:24)

By rewriting cmarkgfm's bindings from CFFI to the Python C API, the project successfully ported GitHub's cmark-gfm Markdown parser to Pyodide. The resulting wheel is fully functional, requires no further building, and supports all GitHub Flavored Markdown features with high performance, thanks to direct C code execution via WebAssembly. Users can integrate the package into Pyodide (see [Pyodide documentation](https://pyodide.org/)) and render robust Markdown—including tables, strikethrough, and task lists—directly in the browser. This port demonstrates a practical technique for bringing other CFFI-based packages to WebAssembly/Pyodide environments.

**Key Findings:**
- All GFM features (tables, strikethrough, smart typography, etc.) work accurately.
- Integration and pytest test suites pass 100%.
- The port uses only Python C API bindings, improving compatibility and speed.
- [Project source & wheel available](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm).

### [Python Markdown Library Comparison: cmarkgfm vs Alternatives](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/python-markdown-comparison#readme) (2025-10-22 21:27)

Comparing seven prominent Python markdown libraries, cmarkgfm—bindings to GitHub’s C-based CommonMark/GFM parser—proved dramatically faster (10-50x) than pure Python options such as mistune, Python-Markdown, and marko. The benchmark, spanning small to large markdown documents, consistently found cmarkgfm excels in both speed and stability, making it ideal for high-volume or performance-critical applications. However, cmarkgfm trades extensibility and custom output formats for speed, so libraries like mistune (for fast pure Python and custom rendering) or Python-Markdown (for extension-rich configurability) may be preferable for projects prioritizing flexibility or ease of customization. See [cmarkgfm's repository](https://github.com/theacodes/cmarkgfm) and [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) for details.

**Key findings:**
- cmarkgfm is 10-50x faster than pure Python markdown libraries, especially for large documents.
- Pure Python options offer greater extensibility, custom output formats, and API access, but at the cost of speed.
- Best library choice depends on project needs: cmarkgfm for raw speed/GFM compatibility, mistune for pure Python speed/customization, Python-Markdown for plugins/extensions.

### [Datasette Plugins Analysis - Complete Report](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/datasette-plugin-alpha-versions#readme) (2025-10-20 23:50)

Datasette Plugins Analysis presents a systematic evaluation of 44 key plugins from the Datasette ecosystem, focusing on dependencies, permissions hooks, and release patterns as of October 2025. The study finds that 89% of these plugins rely on ALPHA versions of Datasette, with only 8 plugins having stable releases and just 5 supporting stable Datasette while using advanced hooks like `register_permissions()`. The open datasets, such as [`datasette_plugins_analysis.json`](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugins-analysis/blob/main/datasette_plugins_analysis.json) and analysis scripts, support deeper inspection and maintenance planning as Datasette nears its 1.0 milestone. This enables maintainers to prioritize updates for plugins with alpha dependencies and track release maturity across the ecosystem.

**Key Findings:**
- 39 plugins depend on Datasette ALPHA versions; 34 of these have no stable releases.
- Only 5 plugins use `register_permissions()` without requiring ALPHA Datasette.
- 8 of the analyzed plugins currently offer at least one stable release.  
- Main analysis and scripts are available [here](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugins-analysis) for further plugin and dependency tracking.

### [DeepSeek-OCR on NVIDIA GB10 (ARM64 + CUDA 13.0)](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark#readme) (2025-10-20 16:18)

Successfully deployed DeepSeek-OCR on an NVIDIA GB10 (ARM64, sm_121) by upgrading to PyTorch 2.9.0+cu130 so CUDA 13.0 wheels could be used instead of building from source. The repo includes automated scripts (setup.sh, run_ocr.py) that load the 6.3GB safetensors model (~34s) and run GPU inference (~58s for a 3503×1668 image), producing annotated images, markdown/text outputs and bounding boxes with validated multi-column accuracy. Flash-attn failed to compile on ARM64 and the pipeline falls back to eager attention, but overall accuracy and production readiness were confirmed. Reproducible instructions, logs and scripts are provided in the DeepSeek-OCR repo and the PyTorch cu130 wheel index linked below.  

- Key findings: PyTorch 2.9.0+cu130 provides forward compatibility for sm_121 (no source build needed).  
- Performance: model load ≈34s, inference ≈58s; detected 2257 text tokens / 921 vision tokens.  
- Artifacts & links: DeepSeek-OCR code/model (https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) and PyTorch cu130 wheel index (https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130).

### [SQLite Hierarchical Permission System — Proof of Concept](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-permissions-poc#readme) (2025-10-20 15:22)

A proof-of-concept implements a fully SQLite-based hierarchical permission system that computes allowed database/table pairs by cascading rules across child (table), parent (database), and global levels with DENY-over-ALLOW semantics; it uses only plain SQL (CTEs + SQLite JSON functions) and is built on SQLite (https://sqlite.org). Actor and token inputs are JSON-parsed inside the query so a single CTE-based SQL statement resolves per-resource decisions (child → parent → global) and then intersects results with optional token scope, ensuring tokens can only restrict, not grant, access; behavior is validated with a pytest test suite (https://pytest.org). The demo includes a minimal schema, multiple simulated “hook” rule sources, example data, and 11 test scenarios that show child-level ALLOW overriding parent DENY, child-level DENY blocking parent ALLOW, default-deny behavior, and token intersection semantics.

Key findings:
- Pure-SQL implementation (no UDFs/extensions) using CTEs and sqlite JSON helpers.
- Cascading precedence: child > parent > global; at the same level DENY beats ALLOW.
- Token scoping applied via INTERSECT; tokens cannot elevate permissions.
- Single-query engine returns final db/table pairs; schema and tests are compact and extensible.
- 11 pytest scenarios confirm intended conflict-resolution rules and edge cases.

### [minijinja vs jinja2 Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2#readme) (2025-10-20 03:22)

Benchmarking the Python bindings for minijinja (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) against Jinja2 (https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) on Python 3.14 and 3.14t measured template render performance using a realistic e-commerce template with inheritance, loops, and ~65KB HTML output. The suite runs 200 iterations per scenario, captures mean/median/std/min/max, and provides reproducible scripts (run_benchmark.sh, benchmark.py) plus matplotlib charts to visualize results. Jinja2 is faster on stock Python 3.14, while minijinja gains more from the free-threaded 3.14t build, indicating minijinja may be better positioned for free-threaded Python even though it’s currently slower in absolute terms. Everything needed to reproduce the 15–20 minute benchmark and view detailed analysis is included in the repository.

- Jinja2 (3.14): 0.990 ms mean vs Minijinja: 1.528 ms mean — Jinja2 ≈ 1.54× faster on 3.14  
- Jinja2 slows ~14% on 3.14t (1.127 ms); Minijinja speeds up ~13% on 3.14t (1.336 ms)  
- Artifacts: JSON results, comparison/distribution/speedup/timeline charts, and BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md with full analysis

### [Pyodide Simple Demo](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/node-pyodide#readme) (2025-10-20 03:19)

A compact demo shows how to run Python scripts inside a WebAssembly sandbox from Node.js using Pyodide: after npm install, launching node server-simple.js executes example-simple.py and writes generated files to the output/ directory. The project demonstrates a minimal server-side integration pattern for Pyodide (https://pyodide.org/) under Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) and is aimed at quick experimentation with sandboxed Python execution. It requires Node.js v16 or later and provides a simple starting point for extending Python-in-WASM workflows in Node applications.

- Executes Python in WebAssembly via Pyodide and writes outputs to output/
- Minimal commands: npm install; node server-simple.js
- Recommended Node.js v16+ for best compatibility

## Updating this README

This README uses [cogapp](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/) to automatically generate project descriptions.

### Automatic updates

A GitHub Action automatically runs `cog -r -P README.md` on every push to main and commits any changes to the README or new `_summary.md` files.

### Manual updates

To update locally:

```bash
# Run cogapp to regenerate the project list
cog -r -P README.md
```

The script automatically:
- Discovers all subdirectories in this folder
- Gets the first commit date that touched each folder's `README.md` and sorts by date, newest first
- For each folder, checks if a `_summary.md` file exists
- If the summary exists, it uses the cached version
- If not, it generates a new summary using `llm -m <!--[[[cog
print(MODEL, end='')
]]]-->
github/gpt-4.1
<!--[[[end]]]-->` with a prompt that creates engaging descriptions with bullets and links
- Creates markdown links to each project folder on GitHub
- New summaries are saved to `_summary.md` to avoid regenerating them on every run

To regenerate a specific project's description, delete its `_summary.md` file and run `cog -r -P README.md` again.
